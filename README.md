Indepent Research Project

In this project I created a system that allows the player to play an infinite runner, one level as no DDA and increases the speed of the objects periodically and will slow down if one is hit and then speed up periodically as well. All the objects that can spawn have the same probability to spawn. The other level, has a DDA attachted to it and will increase the speed of obsticles based on the probability of the player hitting an obsticle. The probability of the player hitting an obsticle also determines the probability of a power up spawning, for example, if the player is strugelling the speed of objects will be slowed down and health and invincibility powerups will be more likly to spawn.
